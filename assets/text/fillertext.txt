Brief Bio:
Ian Roy, a trailblazer in the intersection of technology, education, and social impact, serves as the Director of Design and Innovation at Brandeis University. An alumnus of Brandeis with a dual major in Economics and Philosophy, Ian's journey back to academia was spurred by a personal tragedy that reshaped his outlook on life. Founding the Research Technology and Innovation department and the Brandeis MakerLab, he has been instrumental in integrating technology with liberal arts and business education. His focus on "Mistake Driven Learning" and "Design to Repair the World" reflects his commitment to using technology as a tool for social good. Ian's work, spanning across various disciplines, embodies a philosophy of creating impactful change through innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration.

Project 1: Brandeis MakerLab
Under Ian's leadership, the Brandeis MakerLab has evolved from a concept to a vibrant hub of innovation and creativity. The MakerLab is not just a space for technological exploration; it's a community where students and faculty from diverse disciplines collaborate on projects that blend technology with social impact. Key achievements include expanding the lab's capabilities with over 100 3D printers and initiating community-focused projects like designing affordable prosthetics, contributing to environmental sustainability, and developing solutions for local societal challenges.

Project 2: DeisHacks Hackathon for Social Good
Ian co-founded the DeisHacks Hackathon, an event that stands at the forefront of social enterprise in education. DeisHacks uniquely sources and implements projects in partnership with business students on the boards of local nonprofits. This annual event not only promotes student innovation but also ensures that their creations have real-world applications and community impact. It's a testament to Ian's belief in the power of hands-on, project-based learning to solve actual societal problems.

Project 3: Interdisciplinary Course Development
Ian's role as an educator is highlighted in his development and teaching of interdisciplinary courses such as "Digital Fabrication with Robotics" and "Culture in 3D." These courses, taught across the International Business School, Anthropology Department, and Engineering Program, demonstrate his approach to integrating technical skills with a broader understanding of cultural and societal issues. His courses emphasize experiential learning, where students engage in "Mini Kobayashi Maru" scenarios, fostering resilience, creativity, and a readiness to tackle complex challenges.

Here's a festive poem about the cat in the Santa hat:

In a cozy room where the yuletide glows,
A whiskered visage in repose,
Clad in red, with a hat askew,
A feline’s charm in holiday view.

‘Neath the twinkling tree, he makes his bed,
With dreams of catnip dancing in his head,
His paws tucked in, a silent mew,
Whispering wishes of a "Meowy Christmas" to you.

The ornaments reflect in his gaze,
A shimmering dance, a soft-hued blaze,
He’s a silent sentinel for the night's long keep,
‘Midst the rustle of paper, he drifts to sleep.

With each gentle purr and every soft breath,
He weaves warmth into the cold winter’s depth,
A gift of joy, wrapped in fur so fine,
This Christmas cat, a friend of mine.

As carols rise and the night grows deep,
May his serenity into your heart creep,
For in this season of love and peace,
His presence alone is a sweet release.

So here he rests, in festive attire,
Igniting in hearts the Yuletide fire,
With a meow so soft, a whisper, a hiss,
A furry little herald of Christmas bliss.
